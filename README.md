## Detecting Failure:
### Business Understanding
Equipment fail with oil wells can bring various negative impacts to both the company and environment. Thus, detecting failure event is an essential task. Several sensors are used for gathering various information from the equipment in order to detect equipments faliure. With the help of predictive models, equipment failure can be easier to find in a timely manner.
### Data Understanding
A data set has been provided that has documented failure events that occurred on surface equipment and down-hole equipment. For each failure event, data has been collected from over 107 sensors that collect a variety of physical information both on the surface and below the ground. These sensors can be categorized as two types: discrete and histogram(time-based). The goal is to categorize whether or not the given equipment pattern shows the equipment failure. Using this information, how can we minimize costs associated with failures?

Thus, the goal of this dataset is to do a classification task on sensor data such that we predict failures that occur both on the surface and below the ground. This information can be used to send crews out to a well location to fix equipment on the surface or send a workover rig to the well to pull down-hole equipment and address the failure.
